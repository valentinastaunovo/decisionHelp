# decisionHelp
I made this project to be a helpful hand when a group or even an individual needs a helping hand in figuring out their morning plans. The code will ask if you want solely coffee, coffee and a snack, coffee and a meal, or any combination of those things and then provide pre-set examples of places in Los Angeles that will satisfy those needs. 
This can come in handy for either an indisive indivual(like myself) or a group who may have different wants for their morning to ensure that all wants are satisfied.
